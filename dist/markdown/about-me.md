# About Me
Hey there, I'm Rohan. I am a third year [Software Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/) student specializing in Artifical Intellingence at the
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) currently looking for Summer 2024 Internships!

I take messy data and build software to tell you your next step.

During my most recent role at [Nuclear Promise X](https://www.npxinnovation.ca/), I took all sorts of data to inform my team of their steps:
* I built a **Nuclear Process Management** tool with **150+ users** called **ModX** to notify stakeholders of their next steps to follow existing Nuclear protocols (Next.js, Material UI, Express.js, MySQL, Docker) 

* I created a **Nuclear-specific ChatGPT** tool with **300+ users** called **NPXAI** to take related reference documents to parse and query them through a Chatbot interface (Next.js, MySQL, Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Search, OpenAI Embeddings, Azure Blob Storage, Azure AI Search)

Previously, I have built a graphical display for the whole [GRCS](https://kpmg.com/ca/en/home/services/advisory/risk-consulting/governance-risk-compliance.html) department (300+ people) when I interned at [KPMG](https://kpmg.com/ca/en/home.html) as a Data Analyst and a decision optimizer during my internship at the [Royal Bank of Canada](https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/personal.html) as a Backend Software Engineer.

My current interests lie primarily in scalable full-stack development and unique applications of Machine Learning such as Generative AI and niche Reinforcement Learning models. I'm also interested in robotics (I mentored a team to win a regional championship called [Hephaestus 6390](https://www.hephaestus6390.com/)) and finance (I cofounded a design team called [Wat Street](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wat-street/mycompany/)).

On the side I make music and lift as well!
